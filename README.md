# malyan-m150-marlin-1.1.3-ABL-noSD
Marlin 1.1.3 hex file for Malyan M150 with Auto Bed Leveling Bilinear enabled and SD Card Support disabled. Otherwise the file size would be too big.
This is based on the work of deprav3d (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2376302).
I used Hoolyhoos Inductive Probe Mount (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1960419).
